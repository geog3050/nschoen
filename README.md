# GEOG:3050 Repository - Natalie Schoen
I am an undergrad student at the University of Iowa getting a B.A. in Environmental Planning and a B.A. in Geographic Information System (GIS). I am interested in conservation and environmental justice issues. While I am currently working for the AmeriCorps preforming conservation work as well as working part time as a GIS intern for the DNR. I hope to one day work as a disaster management planner.

# Repository Description
This respoitory serves as a database for all the assignments, quizzes, and projects that I created during my Spatial Programming class at University of Iowa. Files included are:
1. Assignments: This folder includes two folders labelled "Corrections" and "Original". The "Original" folder contains all 7 coding assignments as they were originally submitted and the "Corrections" folder contains the same 7 coding assignments, but with changes made after instructor feedback.
2. Florida_County: This folder contains a feature class layer with information on the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) ranking for counties in Florida. This layer was created by the CDC and can be used as sample data for the final project code, which is also available in the repository.
3. Quizzes: This folder contains all of the quiz coding created throughout the semester.
4. FinalProject.py: This file is the python code that was developed for the final project. This code was developed to understand the vulnerability of communities in the United States to flooding events. This code was tested using the "Florida_County" and "Florida.csv" data available in the repository, but a user could use other data for different States from the same sources.
5. Florida.csv: This is the second input data used to test the final project code. This dataset was taken from SHELDUS and contains information on hazard loss data, specifically losses from flooding events. Similar to the "Florida_County" dataset, a user could input data from another state into the code.
6. WorkflowModel.png: This image is the workflow model that was used to develope the code for the final project. The workflow outlines the basic steps from the code.
